# Data-Structure-Efficiency-Analysis
# This project serves as a study and analysis of efficiency of simple data structures and their algorithms using C++.
# Data was collected from hash tables with chaining (quadratic, linear), linear hash tables, binary search trees, and linked lists.
# The report concluded that hash tables with quadratic chaining was the most effective way to store data, search, add, and delete values.
