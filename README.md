# Data Structure Efficiency Analysis
 This project serves as a study and analysis of efficiency of simple data structures and their algorithms using C++.
 Data was collected from hash tables with probing (quadratic, linear), hash tables with linked lists, hashing with chaining, binary search trees, and linked lists.
 The report concluded that hash tables with quadratic chaining were the most effective way to store data, search, add, and delete values from a large dataset (40,000 integer  entitites)
